squeekboard (1.21.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
  * d/control: add missing dependencies
    Upstream moved to `clap` v4 and now requires `libbsd`. Moreover, the
    binary package now recommends a new font for greek polytonic (so it gets
    pulled in by default, but users can easily uninstall it).
    We also take this opportunity to bump Standards-Version (no change
    needed) and improve the package's long description.
  * d/patches: drop upstreamed and obsolete patches
  * debian: add lintian-overrides
    `squeekboard` uses a crate which includes a Rust rewrite of `libyaml`.
    `lintian` falsely recognizes this as an embedded copy of the original
    `libyaml` and raises an error we should ignore.

squeekboard (1.20.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * desktop-file: Add X-GNOME-* for session management
  * Use update-alternatives to provide sm.puri.OSK0.desktop.
    This allows other implementations to work as OSK for phosh as well.
    (Closes: #1023510)
  * d/control: Version conflict on phosh-osk-stub.
    We can happily coexist with the version that uses
    update-alternatives.

squeekboard (1.20.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian: drop ppc64el workaround and patch.
    This issue was only present with `rustc` 1.59 and has been fixed since
    then (current `rustc` in Debian testing is 1.60), we can now drop our
    workaround.
  * d/rules: don't use online dependencies.
    By default, `squeekboard` uses a fixed `Cargo.lock` so it can get the
    right versions when fetching dependencies online. However, on Debian we
    use the packaged crates instead of letting `cargo` fetch them online, so
    we should disable this flag when configuring the build.

squeekboard (1.19.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/patches: relax clap dependency
  * d/rules: fix build on ppc64el.
    Due to a rust bug on ppc64el, `squeekboard-test-layout` fails to build
    properly, causing the whole build to fail on this architecture. This
    prevents newer versions of the package to migrate to testing.
    This bug is due to the linker trying to resolve unused symbols when
    building a rust binary and is only seen when using version 1.59.0 of
    rustc.
    This commit works around this problem by adding the needed linker flags
    to ensure all symbols are properly resolved, even those not actually
    used by the binaries.
    Those changes can be reverted once a newer version of rustc is packaged
    for Debian.
    Note: this commit also drops the `xgot` feature for mips64el as it is
    now automatically enabled for this architecture in Debian's rustc.
    (Closes: #1016396)

squeekboard (1.17.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 1.17.1
  * d/patches: update patch fixing build.
    The patch we used to carry is replaced by an upstream backport, as it
    requires another change already taken into account there.
  * d/patches: backport upstream patches fixing sizing (Closes: #1007115)
  * d/control: update clap build dependency.
    We now depend on clap v3, not v2, and need the "std" feature.
  * d/patches: fix build on i386.

squeekboard (1.17.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/patches: fix build failure due to newer crate version.

squeekboard (1.17.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/gbp.conf: change upstream tag handling.
    This allows us to use `gbp import-orig --uscan`.
  * New upstream version 1.17.0
  * d/patches: drop backported patch.
    It is now included in the current upstream release.
  * d/copyright: simplify and add missing records.
    Lots of copyright records are somewhat redundant, attributing copyright
    to Daiki Ueno, Red Hat, Purism and/or "Squeekboard Contributors". As we
    can safely assume the latter 2 groups have touched almost every file in
    this repo, let's make this the default copyright. Additional records are
    added only for files explicitly mentioning different authorship and/or
    license. This makes the copyright file a bit simpler and also more
    accurate.
    This commit also adds records for new files (or ones that weren't
    noticed before).
